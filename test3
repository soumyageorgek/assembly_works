a) This one is simple.

   Compile opt1.c in the normal way:

   cc -S opt1.c

   read and understand the asm code.


   Now, compile with all optimizations enabled:

   cc -S -O3 opt1.c 

   Read the code and find out how the compiler performs
   function inlining.
 
b) This is a bit more complex.

   Compile opt2.c with and without optimization (as mentioned
   above).

   Find out how the compiler performs "Common Sub Expression
   Elimination"


c) Write a blog post discussing these two optimizations
